**Retinal Disease Diagnosis using Deep Learning with TensorFlow**

This project utilizes Deep Learning techniques with TensorFlow to diagnose retinal diseases based on retinal images.

**Features:**

* Preprocess and analyze retinal image datasets.
* Train and evaluate Deep Learning models for diagnosing various retinal diseases like Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), and Glaucoma.
* Predict the presence of a specific retinal disease based on a provided retinal image.
* Visualize the disease regions and decision boundaries within the image.

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow library
* NumPy library
* Pandas library
* OpenCV library
* Scikit-learn library (optional)

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/bard/retinal_disease_diagnosis.git
```
2. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas scikit-learn opencv-python
```

**Data:**

1. Acquire datasets containing retinal images with labeled diagnoses for various retinal diseases. These can be publicly available datasets or collected from medical institutions.
2. Place the datasets in the designated directory within the project folder.

**Usage:**

1. Run the script for the specific disease prediction task:
    - `python amd_prediction.py` for AMD prediction.
    - `python dr_prediction.py` for DR prediction.
    - `python glaucoma_prediction.py` for Glaucoma prediction.
2. The script will automatically load the data, perform preprocessing, train the Deep Learning model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the results.
3. You can modify the scripts to experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, data augmentation techniques, and disease focus.

**Output:**

* The script will print the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) of the trained model.
* It will also generate visualizations highlighting the predicted disease regions within the retinal image.

**Further improvements:**

* Explore different Deep Learning architectures like CNNs or transformers for potentially improved performance.
* Implement segmentation techniques to accurately delineate the boundaries of diseased areas.
* Develop a user interface for interactive disease prediction with image upload and diagnosis visualization.
* Integrate with medical imaging software for seamless integration into clinical workflows.
